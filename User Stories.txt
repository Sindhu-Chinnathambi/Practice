User Stories...................

>>>Its about Client Requirements given by customer
user story is a short, simple description.
User stories are designed to strongly shift the focus from writing about features to discussing them.
In fact, these discussions are more important than whatever text is written.

What Makes a Good User Story?................................

3C's of a user story:
          card
          conversation
          confirmation

Card: Written description of the story, used for planning and as a reminder.
Conversation: where a detailed description of the user story is discussed. The written Card is modified to reflect the current 
              shared understanding of this conversation.
Confirmation: Confirmation represents the acceptance criteria, which is how the product owner will confirm that the story has been executed
              to their level of satisfaction.Confirmation represents the conditions of satisfaction.

How to write a user story................

Writing good user stories in Scrum requires an understanding of the basic user story template, 
a focus on the user or customer, and a clear picture of the desired functionality.

User Story Template....................

When writing a user story, remember that user stories follow a standard template.

As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >.
                or
“As a [persona], I [want to], [so that].”

For example, user stories might look like....................................

As sindhu, I want to invite my friends, so we can enjoy this service together.  or
As Sascha, I want to organize my work, so I can feel more in control. or
As a manager, I want to understand my Team progress, so I can better report our sucess and failures. 

Who writes user stories?........................
anyone can write use story.
1. Developer.
2. Team member.
3. product owner.->ownership will be with him
4. Some times ->scrum master.
Acceptence criteria come up with the team, product owner decide to priority or depriortise. So, acceptence criteria is with product owner.


STRUCTURE:

              Initiative                           Intiative:are collections of epic that drive toward a common goal. EX:Scool management system [title of the project]
                  |
      ___________________________
      |                          |
   Epics                       Epics               Epics:are large bodies of work that can be broken down into several smaller task. EX: loginpg,attendance,fees[modules]
     |                           |                                
____________               ____________
|           |              |           |           user story:are short requirements or requests written from the prespective of end user. EX:breif details about the modules.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

	In Agile, acceptance criteria refer to a set of predefined requirements that must be met to mark a user story complete. 
Acceptance criteria are also sometimes called the “definition of done” because they determine the scope and requirements 
that must be executed by developers to consider the user story finished.

How to write acceptance criteria?

	There is a process in software engineering known as behavior-driven development. 
It describes a process that encourages communication and collaboration between business participants 
in a software project and the development team.

Two Common Formats: Scenario-oriented format
                    Rule oriented format
					
Scenario-oriented format:

	The scenario-oriented AC approach is inherited from behavior-driven development and is an excellent way 
to set guidelines on when developers should begin and end testing a certain feature. 

Scenario – In the first statement, you’ll have to write the name of the behavior that you’re describing.
Given – The second statement refers to the beginning stage of the scenario.
When – The third statement involves a particular action that you want the user to make.
Then – This is used to describe the outcome of the third statement.
And – You can use “And” to continue any statement except “Scenario.”

Example: Banking Application

User story: As a credit cardholder, I want to receive a notification for remaining balance 
            for every transaction so that i could not go to netbanking.
			
Scenario: Notification for the balance
Given: The user has opened a bank account
And: The user has received a credit card
When: The user has made a transaction
Then: The system notifies the user of their balance

Rule oriented format:
The rule-oriented format is basically like writing a simple bullet list with all the features you want your product to have.
By doing this, you’ll ensure that the development team understands your vision clearly.

INVEST-ing in User Stories.............................

  Widely accepted around the world, the acronym INVEST represents criteria or checklist that can help assess the quality of a user story. 

Independent:
    The user story must be self-contained to ensure it can be released without relying on another

Negotiable:
     The user story mustn’t be written like a contract. Only understand the essence of the user’s requirement, opening space for conversations

Valuable:
     Value is delivered to the end-user

Estimable:
     The user story should be able to estimated to prioritize them and to fit them into sprints

Small:
     The user story must be in a way that can be completed in a span 3-4 days

Testable:
     A pre-written criteria must confirm the user story
